#DartRocket

DartRocket is a HTML5 Game Framework, which is written in Dart and uses the StageXL rendering engine.
The main goal of this framework is to provide an easy to use solution for HTML5 game making with the Dart language.

##How to start?
At the moment there is no starting guide, but you can find some examples in the package.

##Documentation
You can find the documentation in the source. I need some time to generate them.
If you are brave enough, then look into these: game,state,statemanager,animatedsprite dart files

##Blog
The Framework has a blog here: <http://dartrocket.blogspot.hu/>
